Students nowadays always try to find the most excuses when it comes to going to class: "Too early in the morning" or "I learn better by self studying." While some of these claims are true, there is a huge correlation of increased exam scores to the amount of days you go to class and participate. On the other hand, from personal experience, I had professors talk about how they wished more people would spend their time now and come to class, rather than studying all night before the exam. So I thought about a potential solution where students have enough incentive to come to class, which in turn would help professors teach by hopefully increasing the class participation. A classic win-win senario. 

# What it does #

As an MVP status (more features to be added later), the app should facilitate the attendance taking process and give a way to give professors real-time feedback. 

For attendance: 

At the start of every class time, with a five minute buffer, the student would sign in and click the check in button. Then through geolocation, the app would make sure the student was in the classroom and sign them in for the day. Every day that the student signs in, a small percentage of their study guide/practice exam would reveal itself. So in theory anyone who would get 90% attendance or more would get the entire study guide/practice exams. Also, there will be an additional feature in that when the exam season rolls around, every student would accomplished coming at a percentage set by the professor (let's say 95% attendance) would get an unique code. On the exam there would be space to put their unique code for extra points. 

For real-time feedback:

As the lecture continues, there will be space for students to put questions in a group chat of the class, and a way to answer a poll of their understanding. The teacher can monitor the graph of understand and the questions by the students to see where people's understanding went astray.
